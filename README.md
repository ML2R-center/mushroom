# Triple Classification Using Regions and Fine-Grained Entity Typing

A triple in knowledge-graph has the form of *(head, relation, tail)*. Triple classification is to determine the truth value of an unknown triple. This is a hard task for 1-to-N relations using vector-based embedding approach. We propose a new region-based embedding approach using fine-grained type chains. A novel geometrical process is proposed to extend pre-trained entities vector into *n*-dimensional balls (*n*-ball) with the condition that *head* ball shall contain its *tail* balls. An *n*-ball serves as a kernel of SVM supported by *tail* *n*-balls. Known *tails* with the fine-grained typing of *head* is represented by a nested kernel structures of SVMs. An unknown triple *(h, r, x)* will be predicted as true, when *x*'s *n*-ball is located in the *r*-subspace of  *h*'s *n*-ball, following the same construction of known *tails* of *h*. Experiments are based on large datasets derived from benchmark datasets, WN11, FB13, and WN18. Results show that the performance of the new method is related with the length of the type chain and the quality of pre-trained entity-embeddings and that performances of long chains with well-trained entity-embeddings greatly outperform other methods in the literature.
